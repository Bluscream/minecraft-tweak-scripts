# Miscellaneous scripts/tweaks

Scripts and tweaks for Minecraft, mostly used to debug things/display information that's useful for documentation.  These scripts are provided as-is (they usually require additional work to actually be used with the real game, EG modifying version JSONs).

They're written in whatever language I felt like at the time.  Some use python and [Jawa](http://jawa.tkte.ch), others are JARs, and others are in powershell.
