# Miscellaneous scripts/tweaks

Scripts and tweaks for Minecraft, mostly used to debug things/display information that's useful for documentation.  These scripts use [Jawa](http://jawa.tkte.ch), and are provided as-is (they usually require additional work to actually be used with the real game, EG modifying version JSONs).
